Product Reviews) is one of Amazons iconic products. In a period of over two decades since the first review in 1995, millions of Amazon customers have contributed over a hundred million reviews to express opinions and describe their experiences regarding products on the Amazon.com website. This makes Amazon Customer Reviews a rich source of information for academic researchers in the fields of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Information Retrieval (IR), and Machine Learning (ML), amongst others. Accordingly, we are releasing this data to further research in multiple disciplines related to understanding customer product experiences. Specifically, this dataset was constructed to represent a sample of customer evaluations and opinions, variation in the perception of a product across geographical regions, and promotional intent or bias in reviews.\n\nOver 130+ million customer reviews are available to researchers as part of this release. The data is available in TSV files in the amazon-reviews-pds S3 bucket in AWS US East Region.

Lack of facial expressions and voice modulations make detecting emotions in text a challenging problem. For instance, as humans, on reading ''Why don't you ever text me!'' we can either interpret it as a sad or angry emotion and the same ambiguity exists for machines. However, the context of dialogue can prove helpful in detection of the emotion. In this task, given a textual dialogue i.e. an utterance along with two previous turns of context, the goal was to infer the underlying emotion of the utterance by choosing from four emotion classes - Happy, Sad, Angry and Others. To facilitate the participation in this task, textual dialogues from user interaction with a conversational agent were taken and annotated for emotion classes after several data processing steps. A training data set of 30160 dialogues, and two evaluation data sets, Test1 and Test2, containing 2755 and 5509 dialogues respectively were released to the participants. A total of 311 teams made submissions to this task. The final leader-board was evaluated on Test2 data set, and the highest ranked submission achieved 79.59 micro-averaged F1 score.

Especially in the case of finance and economic texts, annotated\ncollections are a scarce resource and many are reserved for proprietary use\nonly. To resolve the missing training data problem, we present a collection of\n\u223c 5000 sentences to establish human-annotated standards for benchmarking\nalternative modeling techniques.\n\nThe objective of the phrase level annotation task was to classify each example\nsentence into a positive, negative or neutral category by considering only the\ninformation explicitly available in the given sentence. Since the study is\nfocused only on financial and economic domains, the annotators were asked to\nconsider the sentences from the view point of an investor only; i.e. whether\nthe news may have positive, negative or neutral influence on the stock price.\nAs a result, sentences which have a sentiment that is not relevant from an\neconomic or financial perspective are considered neutral.\n\nThis release of the financial phrase bank covers a collection of 4840\nsentences. The selected collection of phrases was annotated by 16 people with\nadequate background knowledge on financial markets. Three of the annotators\nwere researchers and the remaining 13 annotators were master\u2019s students at\nAalto University School of Business with majors primarily in finance,\naccounting, and economics.\n\nGiven the large number of overlapping annotations (5 to 8 annotations per\nsentence), there are several ways to define a majority vote based gold\nstandard.

Hate speech detection has been actively done for languages such as English, German, or Italian, where manually labeled corpus has been released. In this work, we first present 9.4K manually labeled entertainment news comments for identifying Korean toxic speech, collected from a widely used online news platform in Korea. The comments are annotated regarding social bias and hate speech since both aspects are correlated. The inter-annotator agreement Krippendorff{'}s alpha score is 0.492 and 0.496, respectively. We provide benchmarks using CharCNN, BiLSTM, and BERT, where BERT achieves the highest score on all tasks. The models generally display better performance on bias identification, since the hate speech detection is a more subjective issue. Additionally, when BERT is trained with bias label for hate speech detection, the prediction score increases, implying that bias and hate are intertwined. We make our dataset publicly available and open competitions with the corpus and benchmarks.\",\n}", "description": "Human-annotated Korean corpus collected from a popular domestic entertainment news aggregation platform\nfor toxic speech detection.

Unlike recently released datasets, such as DeepMind\nCNN/DailyMail and SQuAD, the proposed SearchQA was constructed to reflect a full pipeline of general question-answering. That is, we start not from an existing article\nand generate a question-answer pair, but start from an existing question-answer pair, crawled from J! Archive, and augment it with text snippets retrieved by Google.\nFollowing this approach, we built SearchQA, which consists of more than 140k question-answer pairs with each pair having 49.6 snippets on average. Each question-answer-context\n tuple of the SearchQA comes with additional meta-data such as the snippet's URL, which we believe will be valuable resources for future research. We conduct human evaluation\n as well as test two baseline methods, one simple word selection and the other deep learning based, on the SearchQA.

We show that, despite the noise in the Common-Crawl-based OSCAR data, embeddings trained on OSCAR perform much better than monolingual embeddings trained on Wikipedia. They actually equal or improve the current state of the art in tagging and parsing for all five languages.

Even though each document has a metadata block associated to it, this data lacks any information about the language in which each document is written, making it extremely difficult to use Common Crawl for monolingual applications. We propose a general, highly parallel, multithreaded pipeline to clean and classify Common Crawl by language; we specifically design it so that it runs efficiently on medium to low resource infrastructures where I/O speeds are the main constraint. We develop the pipeline so that it can be easily reapplied to any kind of heterogeneous corpus and so that it can be parameterised to a wide range of infrastructures. We also distribute a 6.3TB version of Common Crawl, filtered, classified by language, shuffled at line level in order to avoid copyright issues, and ready to be used for NLP applications.},\n  language  = {en}\n}", "description": "The Open Super-large Crawled ALMAnaCH coRpus is a huge multilingual corpus obtained by language classification and filtering of the Common Crawl corpus using the goclassy architecture.\\", "downloads": 86079, "paperswithcode_id": "oscar", "tags": ["task_categories:text-generation", "task_ids:language-modeling", "annotations_creators:no-annotation", "language_creators:found", "multilinguality:multilingual", "source_datasets:oscar", "language:af", "language:am", "language:ar", "language:arz", "language:as", "language:az", "language:azb", "language:ba", "language:be", "language:bg", "language:bn", "language:bo", "language:br", "language:ca", "language:ce", "language:ceb", "language:ckb", "language:cs", "language:cv", "language:cy", "language:da", "language:de", "language:dv", "language:el", "language:en", "language:eo", "language:es", "language:et", "language:eu", "language:fa", "language:fi", "language:fr", "language:fy", "language:ga", "language:gl", "language:gu", "language:he", "language:hi", "language:hr", "language:hu", "language:hy", "language:id", "language:is", "language:it", "language:ja", "language:ka", "language:kk", "language:km", "language:kn", "language:ko", "language:ku", "language:ky", "language:la", "language:lb", "language:lo", "language:lt", "language:lv", "language:mg", "language:mhr", "language:mk", "language:ml", "language:mn", "language:mr", "language:ms", "language:mt", "language:my", "language:nds", "language:ne", "language:nl", "language:nn", "language:no", "language:or", "language:os", "language:pa", "language:pl", "language:pnb", "language:ps", "language:pt", "language:ro", "language:ru", "language:sa", "language:sah", "language:sd", "language:sh", "language:si", "language:sk", "language:sl", "language:sq", "language:sr", "language:sv", "language:sw", "language:ta", "language:te", "language:tg", "language:th", "language:tk", "language:tl", "language:tr", "language:tt", "language:ug", "language:uk", "language:ur", "language:uz", "language:vi", "language:yi", "language:zh", "license:cc0-1.0", "size_categories:10M<n<100M", "modality:text", "library:datasets", "library:mlcroissant", "arxiv:2010.14571", "region:us"], "createdAt": "2022-03-23T09:26:03.000Z", "key": ""}

Although there is a long tradition of work in NLP on extracting entities and relations from text, to date there exists little work on the acquisition of business processes from unstructured data such as textual corpora of process descriptions. With this work we aim at filling this gap and establishing the first steps towards bridging data-driven information extraction methodologies from Natural Language Processing and the model-based formalization that is aimed from Business Process Management. For this, we develop the first corpus of business process descriptions annotated with activities, gateways, actors and flow information. We present our new resource, including a detailed overview of the annotation schema and guidelines, as well as a variety of baselines to benchmark the difficulty and challenges of business process extraction from text.", "downloads": 259, "tags": ["task_categories:token-classification", "language:en", "license:mit", "size_categories:n<1K", "arxiv:2203.04860", "region:us", "Business Process Management", "NLP", "ML", "DL"], "createdAt": "2022-04-14T09:35:11.000Z", "key": ""}

We first define a new question type ontology which differentiates the nuanced nature of questions better than widely used question words. A new dataset with 4,959 questions is labeled based on the new ontology. We then propose a novel question type-aware question generation framework, augmented by a semantic graph representation, to jointly predict question focuses and produce the question. Based on this framework, we further use both exemplars and automatically generated templates to improve controllability and diversity. Experiments on two newly collected large-scale datasets show that our model improves question quality over competitive comparisons based on automatic metrics. Human judges also rate our model outputs highly in answerability, coverage of scope, and overall quality. Finally, our model variants with templates can produce questions with enhanced controllability and diversity.\",\n}", "description": "Open-ended question type annotated dataset.", "downloads": 90, "tags": ["task_categories:text-classification", "annotations_creators:expert-generated", "multilinguality:monolingual", "language:en", "license:cc-by-4.0", "size_categories:1K<n<10K", "modality:text", "library:datasets", "library:mlcroissant", "region:us"], "createdAt": "2022-06-28T20:55:58.000Z", "key": ""}

In particular, there is a lack of runnable, real-world datasets required for a range of tasks ranging from neural program synthesis to machine learning-guided program optimization. We introduce a new dataset, ExeBench, which attempts to address this. It tackles two key issues with real-world code: references to external types and functions and scalable generation of IO examples. ExeBench is the first publicly available dataset that pairs real-world C code taken from GitHub with IO examples that allow these programs to be run. We develop a toolchain that scrapes GitHub, analyzes the code, and generates runnable snippets of code. We analyze our benchmark suite using several metrics, and show it is representative of real-world code. ExeBench contains 4.5M compilable and 700k executable C functions. This scale of executable, real functions will enable the next generation of machine learning-based programming tasks.},\nbooktitle = {Proceedings of the 6th ACM SIGPLAN International Symposium on Machine Programming},\npages = {50\u201359},\nnumpages = {10},\nkeywords = {Code Dataset, Program Synthesis, Mining Software Repositories, C, Machine Learning for Code, Compilers},\nlocation = {San Diego, CA, USA},\nseries = {MAPS 2022}\n}", "description": "An ML-scale dataset of executable C functions", "downloads": 1526, "tags": ["region:us"], "createdAt": "2022-07-30T20:07:06.000Z", "key": ""}

However, low-resource languages are mostly left out in these datasets. This is primarily because many widely spoken languages that are not well represented on the web and therefore excluded from the large-scale crawls for datasets. Furthermore, downstream users of these models are restricted to the selection of languages originally chosen for pre-training. This work investigates how to optimally leverage existing pre-trained models to create low-resource translation systems for 16 African languages. We focus on two questions: 1) How can pre-trained models be used for languages not included in the initial pretraining? and 2) How can the resulting translation models effectively transfer to new domains? To answer these questions, we create a novel African news corpus covering 16 languages, of which eight languages are not part of any existing evaluation dataset. We demonstrate that the most effective strategy for transferring both additional languages and additional domains is to leverage small quantities of high-quality translation data to fine-tune large pre-trained models.\",\n}", "description": "MAFAND-MT is the largest MT benchmark for African languages in the news domain, covering 21 languages.
